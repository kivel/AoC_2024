= Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the link:https://adventofcode.com/2024/[2024] edition of the Advent of Code!

== run

This repo uses a binary for each of the days puzzles.
Only those that I could solve - at least partially - are in the repo.

Typicall the `main()` function points to the test data only.
To run the respective main use: `cargo run --bin day1_1`.

== test

I use TDD for the AoC, so I typically use some the `test` subcommand of `cargo`.

[source, bash]
----
cargo test --bin day1_1
cargo test --bin day1_2 -- --nocapture
----

This will run all the tests for `day1_1`, with the test results only.
The second command also prints out the results for `day1_2`.

== helper

The are a few little helpers, for example for reading the ASCII data into a `Vec<String>` for simplicity.

.Reader example
[source, rust]
----
let d = advent_of_code::Reader::read_file("./input/day1_1_test.txt").unwrap();
----
